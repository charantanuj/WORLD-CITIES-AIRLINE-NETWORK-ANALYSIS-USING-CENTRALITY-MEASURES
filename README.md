# WORLD-CITIES-AIRLINE-NETWORK-ANALYSIS-USING-CENTRALITY-MEASURES
The air transportation industry has a great impact on the economy. In this, we analyze the air transportation network in the world to better understand its characteristics. The world's major airports are directly linked to hundreds of airports without intermediate routes. This connection can be described as the network in which the airport is a node and the route will be a connection line. Here we analyze the network which contains 67663 routes between 3321 airports on 548 airlines spanning the globe. We will find the most influential airport in the world using centrality measures such as betweenness centrality, degree centrality, closeness centrality, eigen vector centrality and data analysis. Some of the characteristics are like the busiest airport and the airports which inï¬‚uence trade, alternate path, fastest route, nearest airports, etc. The characteristics helps to find the designated airports meant for improving the economy. The results of this project say about the prominent communication and connections among the airports worldwide.
